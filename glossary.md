### Terms

##### [Hypermedia](https://github.com/RichardLitt/ipfs-textbook#what-does-hypermedia-mean)

"Hypermedia, an extension of the term hypertext, is a nonlinear medium of information which includes graphics, audio, video, plain text and hyperlinks." ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia)) The key to understanding _hypermedia_ as opposed to normal _media_ is the hyperlinks, which are interactive pointers. Nonlinear simply means it's not meant to be read in a line, like a novel, but can be accessed and perused at random locations.
