# Glossary

This glossary is for standalone terms. Many of these may be defined in the main text, but are presented here without a contextual storyline in order to help with lookup.

Please use the appropriate headings and keep all entries alphabetized. Be safe out there, kids.

### Terms

##### [DHT (Distributed Hash Table)]()

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_hash_table):

> A distributed hash table (DHT) is a class of a decentralized distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table: (key, value) pairs are stored in a DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key. Responsibility for maintaining the mapping from keys to values is distributed among the nodes, in such a way that a change in the set of participants causes a minimal amount of disruption. This allows a DHT to scale to extremely large numbers of nodes and to handle continual node arrivals, departures, and failures.

##### [Hypermedia](https://github.com/RichardLitt/ipfs-textbook#what-does-hypermedia-mean)

"Hypermedia, an extension of the term hypertext, is a nonlinear medium of information which includes graphics, audio, video, plain text and hyperlinks." ([Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermedia)) The key to understanding _hypermedia_ as opposed to normal _media_ is the hyperlinks, which are interactive pointers. Nonlinear simply means it's not meant to be read in a line, like a novel, but can be accessed and perused at random locations.
